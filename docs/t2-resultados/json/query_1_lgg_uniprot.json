These two domains are linked by a central stalk rotating inside the F(1) region and a stationary peripheral stalk (PubMed:37244256). During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation (Probable). With the subunit c (ATP5MC1), forms the proton-conducting channel in the F(0) domain, that contains two crucial half-channels (inlet and outlet) that facilitate proton movement from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) into the matrix (PubMed:37244256).

        "protein_length": 317,
        "function_cc": "FUNCTION: APOE is an apolipoprotein, a protein associating with lipid particles, that mainly functions in lipoprotein-mediated lipid transport between organs via the plasma and interstitial fluids (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:1911868, PubMed:6860692). APOE is a core component of plasma lipoproteins and is involved in their production, conversion and clearance (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:1911868, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:23620513, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:6860692, PubMed:9395455). Apolipoproteins are amphipathic molecules that interact both with lipids of the lipoprotein particle core and the aqueous environment of the plasma (PubMed:2762297, PubMed:6860692, PubMed:9395455). As such, APOE associates with chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) but shows a preferential binding to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (PubMed:1911868, PubMed:6860692). It also binds a wide range of cellular receptors including the LDL receptor/LDLR, the LDL receptor-related proteins LRP1, LRP2 and LRP8 and the very low-density lipoprotein receptor/VLDLR that mediate the cellular uptake of the APOE-containing lipoprotein particles (PubMed:12950167, PubMed:1530612, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:20030366, PubMed:20303980, PubMed:2063194, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:7635945, PubMed:7768901, PubMed:8756331, PubMed:8939961). Finally, APOE also has a heparin-binding activity and binds heparan-sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of cells, a property that supports the capture and the receptor-mediated uptake of APOE-containing lipoproteins by cells (PubMed:23676495, PubMed:7635945, PubMed:9395455, PubMed:9488694). A main function of APOE is to mediate lipoprotein clearance through the uptake of chylomicrons, VLDLs, and HDLs by hepatocytes (PubMed:1911868, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:23676495, PubMed:29516132, PubMed:9395455). APOE is also involved in the biosynthesis by the liver of VLDLs as well as their uptake by peripheral tissues ensuring the delivery of triglycerides and energy storage in muscle, heart and adipose tissues (PubMed:2762297, PubMed:29516132). By participating in the lipoprotein-mediated distribution of lipids among tissues, APOE plays a critical role in plasma and tissues lipid homeostasis (PubMed:1917954, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:29516132). APOE is also involved in two steps of reverse cholesterol transport, the HDLs-mediated transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver, and thereby plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:23620513, PubMed:9395455). First, it is functionally associated with ABCA1 in the biogenesis of HDLs in tissues (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:23620513). Second, it is enriched in circulating HDLs and mediates their uptake by hepatocytes (PubMed:9395455). APOE also plays an important role in lipid transport in the central nervous system, regulating neuron survival and sprouting (PubMed:25173806, PubMed:8939961). APOE is also involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, controlling for instance the survival of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (By similarity). Binds to the immune cell receptor LILRB4 (PubMed:30333625). APOE may also play a role in transcription regulation through a receptor-dependent and cholesterol-independent mechanism, that activates MAP3K12 and a non-canonical MAPK signal transduction pathway that results in enhanced AP-1-mediated transcription of APP (PubMed:28111074). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08226, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12950167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14754908, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1530612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1911868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1917954, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20030366, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20303980, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2063194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23620513, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676495, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2762297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28111074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30333625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:6860692, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7635945, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7768901, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8756331, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8939961, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9395455, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9488694, ECO:0000303|PubMed:25173806, ECO:0000303|PubMed:29516132}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Through its interaction with HCV envelope glycoprotein E2, participates in the attachment of HCV to HSPGs and other receptors (LDLr, VLDLr, and SR-B1) on the cell surface and to the assembly, maturation and infectivity of HCV viral particles (PubMed:25122793, PubMed:29695434).

Component of the GAIT (gamma interferon-activated inhibitor of translation) complex which mediates interferon-gamma-induced transcript-selective translation inhibition in inflammation processes (PubMed:23071094). Upon interferon-gamma treatment assembles into the GAIT complex which binds to stem loop-containing GAIT elements in the 3'-UTR of diverse inflammatory mRNAs (such as ceruplasmin) and suppresses their translation (PubMed:23071094).

        "function_cc": "FUNCTION: Molecular chaperone that promotes the maturation, structural maintenance and proper regulation of specific target proteins involved for instance in cell cycle control and signal transduction. Undergoes a functional cycle linked to its ATPase activity. This cycle probably induces conformational changes in the client proteins, thereby causing their activation. Interacts dynamically with various co-chaperones that modulate its substrate recognition, ATPase cycle and chaperone function (PubMed:16478993, PubMed:19696785). Engages with a range of client protein classes via its interaction with various co-chaperone proteins or complexes, that act as adapters, simultaneously able to interact with the specific client and the central chaperone itself. Recruitment of ATP and co-chaperone followed by client protein forms a functional chaperone. After the completion of the chaperoning process, properly folded client protein and co-chaperone leave HSP90 in an ADP-bound partially open conformation and finally, ADP is released from HSP90 which acquires an open conformation for the next cycle (PubMed:26991466, PubMed:27295069). Apart from its chaperone activity, it also plays a role in the regulation of the transcription machinery. HSP90 and its co-chaperones modulate transcription at least at three different levels. They first alter the steady-state levels of certain transcription factors in response to various physiological cues. Second, they modulate the activity of certain epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylases or DNA methyl transferases, and thereby respond to the change in the environment. Third, they participate in the eviction of histones from the promoter region of certain genes and thereby turn on gene expression (PubMed:25973397). Antagonizes STUB1-mediated inhibition of TGF-beta signaling via inhibition of STUB1-mediated SMAD3 ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:24613385). Promotes cell differentiation by chaperoning BIRC2 and thereby protecting from auto-ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasomal machinery (PubMed:18239673). Main chaperone involved in the phosphorylation/activation of the STAT1 by chaperoning both JAK2 and PRKCE under heat shock and in turn, activates its own transcription (PubMed:20353823). Involved in the translocation into ERGIC (endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment) of leaderless cargos (lacking the secretion signal sequence) such as the interleukin 1/IL-1; the translocation process is mediated by the cargo receptor TMED10 (PubMed:32272059). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16478993, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18239673, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19696785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20353823, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24613385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32272059, ECO:0000303|PubMed:25973397, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26991466, ECO:0000303|PubMed:27295069}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Binding to N.meningitidis NadA stimulates monocytes (PubMed:21949862).

Thus, exerts an influence on a plethora of physiological processes, such as embryonic development, tissue regeneration, neuronal plasticity, and inflammation. Sequesters phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at lipid rafts in the plasma membrane of quiescent cells, an action reversed by protein kinase C, ultimately inhibiting exocytosis (PubMed:23704996). During inflammation, promotes the migration and adhesion of inflammatory cells and the secretion of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), particularly in macrophages (PubMed:37949888). Plays an essential role in bacteria-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in the monocytic cell type. Participates in the regulation of neurite initiation and outgrowth by interacting with components of cellular machinery including CDC42 that regulates cell shape and process extension through modulation of the cytoskeleton (By similarity).

Bind transient metals such as copper, zinc and iron. In vitro, can reduce Cu(2+) and Fe(3+) to Cu(+) and Fe(2+), respectively. Amyloid-beta peptides bind to lipoproteins and apolipoproteins E and J in the CSF and to HDL particles in plasma, inhibiting metal-catalyzed oxidation of lipoproteins. Promotes both tau aggregation and TPK II-mediated phosphorylation. Interaction with overexpressed HADH2 leads to oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Also binds GPC1 in lipid rafts.; FUNCTION: [Amyloid-beta protein 42]: More effective reductant than amyloid-beta protein 40.

ATP synthase complex consist of a soluble F(1) head domain - the catalytic core - and a membrane F(1) domain - the membrane proton channel (PubMed:37244256). These two domains are linked by a central stalk rotating inside the F(1) region and a stationary peripheral stalk (PubMed:37244256).

        "function_cc": "FUNCTION: Molecular chaperone implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes, including protection of the proteome from stress, folding and transport of newly synthesized polypeptides, chaperone-mediated autophagy, activation of proteolysis of misfolded proteins, formation and dissociation of protein complexes, and antigen presentation. Plays a pivotal role in the protein quality control system, ensuring the correct folding of proteins, the re-folding of misfolded proteins and controlling the targeting of proteins for subsequent degradation (PubMed:21148293, PubMed:21150129, PubMed:23018488, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661, PubMed:2799391, PubMed:36586411). This is achieved through cycles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and ADP release, mediated by co-chaperones (PubMed:12526792, PubMed:21148293, PubMed:21150129, PubMed:23018488, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661). The co-chaperones have been shown to not only regulate different steps of the ATPase cycle of HSP70, but they also have an individual specificity such that one co-chaperone may promote folding of a substrate while another may promote degradation (PubMed:12526792, PubMed:21148293, PubMed:21150129, PubMed:23018488, PubMed:24732912, PubMed:27916661). The affinity of HSP70 for polypeptides is regulated by its nucleotide bound state. In the ATP-bound form, it has a low affinity for substrate proteins. However, upon hydrolysis of the ATP to ADP, it undergoes a conformational change that increases its affinity for substrate proteins. HSP70 goes through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, which permits cycles of substrate binding and release. The HSP70-associated co-chaperones are of three types: J-domain co-chaperones HSP40s (stimulate ATPase hydrolysis by HSP70), the nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) such as BAG1/2/3 (facilitate conversion of HSP70 from the ADP-bound to the ATP-bound state thereby promoting substrate release), and the TPR domain chaperones such as HOPX and STUB1 (PubMed:24121476, PubMed:24318877, PubMed:26865365, PubMed:27474739). Plays a critical role in mitochondrial import, delivers preproteins to the mitochondrial import receptor TOMM70 (PubMed:12526792). Acts as a repressor of transcriptional activation. Inhibits the transcriptional coactivator activity of CITED1 on Smad-mediated transcription. Component of the PRP19-CDC5L complex that forms an integral part of the spliceosome and is required for activating pre-mRNA splicing. May have a scaffolding role in the spliceosome assembly as it contacts all other components of the core complex. Binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mediates LPS-induced inflammatory response, including TNF secretion by monocytes (PubMed:10722728, PubMed:11276205). Substrate recognition component in chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective protein degradation process that mediates degradation of proteins with a -KFERQ motif: HSPA8/HSC70 specifically recognizes and binds cytosolic proteins bearing a -KFERQ motif and promotes their recruitment to the surface of the lysosome where they bind to lysosomal protein LAMP2 (PubMed:11559757, PubMed:2799391, PubMed:36586411). KFERQ motif-containing proteins are eventually transported into the lysosomal lumen where they are degraded (PubMed:11559757, PubMed:2799391, PubMed:36586411). In conjunction with LAMP2, facilitates MHC class II presentation of cytoplasmic antigens by guiding antigens to the lysosomal membrane for interaction with LAMP2 which then elicits MHC class II presentation of peptides to the cell membrane (PubMed:15894275). Participates in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) quality control pathway in conjunction with J domain-containing co-chaperones and the E3 ligase STUB1 (PubMed:23990462). It is recruited to clathrin-coated vesicles through its interaction with DNAJC6 leading to activation of HSPA8/HSC70 ATPase activity and therefore uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P19120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10722728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11276205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11559757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12526792, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15894275, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21148293, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21150129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23018488, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23990462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24318877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24732912, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27474739, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27916661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2799391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36586411, ECO:0000303|PubMed:24121476, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26865365}.",
