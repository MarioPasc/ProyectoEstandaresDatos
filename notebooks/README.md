# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, experimentation, and demonstrations.

## Intended Contents

- **Exploratory analysis**: Initial data exploration and visualization
- **Experiments**: Testing different approaches and algorithms
- **Demonstrations**: Showcasing project capabilities and features
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for using the project
- **Analysis reports**: Detailed analysis with visualizations and insights

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with dates or version numbers:
- `01_initial_data_exploration.ipynb`
- `02_standard_validation_analysis.ipynb`
- `2025-11-12_experiment_parser_performance.ipynb`

## Best Practices

- Keep notebooks focused on a single topic or question
